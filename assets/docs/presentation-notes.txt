Minimalist design philosophy - keep it simple
Vs an it-er-A-tive (breaking project into parts that eventually form 
a whole), takes longer, can get stuck in on a train-track leading to a train wreck
Flexible without having to go back to the drawing board
(no libraries/frameworks or jQuery)
Easy to use, easy to find it is


4) doing:

Bird’s eye view
Team members cracking like eggshells under pressure
Role confusion/combination

self-defeating decisions, conflicts of interest, things get 
personal, sabotage the team and/or project
